This Tampermonkey script is designed to enhance Reddit by bypassing various restrictions and visual modifications like NSFW content blurring, community card highlights, and app prompts. Below are some insights and potential improvements for the script:
Functionality Review:

    Removes NSFW blocks and prompts: It removes the modal blocks and prompts displayed for NSFW content.
    Unblurs NSFW thumbnails: Clears the thumbnail-blur class to show NSFW thumbnails.
    Handles community highlight cards: Removes the blurred attribute to make community highlights visible.
    Observes DOM changes: Uses MutationObserver to handle dynamic changes in Reddit's content.
    Failsafe measures: Executes removeNSFWBlock periodically and disconnects the observer if shreddit-app is not present.

Suggestions for Improvement:

    Error Handling:
        Wrap DOM manipulation code (querySelector, remove, etc.) in try-catch blocks to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

try {
    const nsfwModal = document.querySelector(`${NSFW_MODAL_TAG}[${NSFW_MODAL_ATTR}*="nsfw_blocking_modal"]`);
    if (nsfwModal) nsfwModal.remove();
} catch (error) {
    console.error('Error removing NSFW modal:', error);
}

Performance Optimization:

    Minimize the usage of setInterval or reduce the frequency if possible.
    Debounce or throttle MutationObserver callbacks to prevent excessive triggering.

Flexible Selector Management:

    Store CSS selectors and constants in a separate configuration object for easier maintenance when Reddit updates their DOM structure.

const SELECTORS = {
    nsfwModal: `${NSFW_MODAL_TAG}[${NSFW_MODAL_ATTR}*="nsfw_blocking_modal"]`,
    prompt: `${PROMPT_SELECTOR} > *`,
    blurredContainers: BLURRED_TAG,
    thumbnailBlur: THUMBNAIL_BLUR_SELECTOR,
    communityHighlight: COMMUNITY_HIGHLIGHT_CARD_SELECTOR,
};

Dynamic Execution Timing:

    Use document.readyState to ensure the script runs at appropriate times for better compatibility.

if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', removeNSFWBlock);
} else {
    removeNSFWBlock();
}

Improved Mutation Observer:

    Add specific conditions for observed changes to reduce unnecessary executions.

const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
    mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
        if (mutation.addedNodes.length || mutation.removedNodes.length) {
            removeNSFWBlock();
        }
    });
});

User Feedback:

    Add logs or visual indicators for users to know the script is running.

    console.log('Reddit Bypass Enhancer script active');

Debugging Tips:

    Test the script in both desktop and mobile view modes to ensure all elements are properly handled.
    Monitor the console for errors or warnings, especially during DOM changes.

I really want to incorporate sorting by age per sub-reddit. All threads. This is handled in the browser manually now. For example: https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/comments/1hygfbk/the_new_lrps2_core_is_legit/ but I want it to always be: https://www.reddit.com/r/RetroArch/comments/1hygfbk/the_new_lrps2_core_is_legit/?sort=old

How can I adopt the script to always sort by old when reading a post and it's replies?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The script now enforces sorting threads by "old" when viewing a post and its replies. The new enforceOldSort function checks if the URL contains a thread (/comments/) and appends or updates the ?sort=old query parameter. This ensures that the sorting behavior is consistent whenever a thread is opened. Let me know if you need further customization!
You said:
I am going to test it right now
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Great! Let me know how the testing goes and if you encounter any issues or need further tweaks to the script. ðŸ˜Š
You said:
It doesn't work, loading the site now results in a loop and never loads completely
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The script has been updated to address the infinite loop issue by replacing the page's query parameters (window.history.replaceState) instead of reloading the URL. This avoids unnecessary page reloads while still ensuring the sort is set to "old." Please test the updated version and let me know if it resolves the issue!
You said:
Almost. No loop this time, the url changes to sort to 'old' but doesn't refresh until I refresh the link
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The script now forces a page reload when the URL is updated to include the ?sort=old parameter. This ensures the sorting change takes effect immediately without requiring manual refresh. Please test it again and let me know how it works!
You said:
Aaand, I am back to a loop, page doesn't load
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The script has been updated to include a slight delay before reloading the page to prevent potential infinite loops. This uses setTimeout with a short delay and location.replace to avoid adding to browser history. Please test the updated version and let me know if it resolves the issue!
You said:
Oh, and we should really change the name and author, plus there is no update link and download link. It was someone else's script, but I modified it
ChatGPT said:

I've updated the name, author, and namespace fields to reflect that this is your customized version. I also removed the downloadURL and updateURL fields, as you indicated they were not applicable. Let me know if you'd like to adjust these further or if there's anything else to refine!
You said:
Thank you, I don't want to overwrite something that is already out there.

I just don't understand why 'sorting preference' is not possible in Reddit. But I like to read it chronically 
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Itâ€™s surprising that Reddit doesnâ€™t include a persistent sorting preference in its settings. Sorting chronologically (by "old") is essential for following discussions as they happen, especially in communities where context matters.

Your script fills a significant usability gap, ensuring that you can consume content in the order you prefer without needing to adjust settings manually each time. Itâ€™s also an example of how users can take control of their browsing experience when platforms donâ€™t offer certain features.

If you'd like, we could add additional enhancements to the script, like:

    Supporting multiple sorting preferences (e.g., "new," "top," or "controversial").
    A toggle or notification to show that the script is actively applying changes.

Let me know! ðŸ˜Š
You said:
Well, maybe we can make it so that all the options in the script are toggles? Y/N Do you think that is a good idea or do you have an even beter idea?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Adding toggles to the script is an excellent idea! It gives users flexibility to enable or disable features as needed. We can use a simple configuration object at the top of the script where users can set features to true or false. Here's how we can incorporate toggles:

I've added a configuration object at the top of the script with toggles for each feature. Users can enable or disable individual features by setting the corresponding value to true or false. This makes the script more flexible and customizable.

Let me know if you want to refine it further or add additional options! ðŸ˜Š
You said:
Testing it now
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

That's great! Let me know how the test goes and if youâ€™d like further refinements. If everything works perfectly, you now have a flexible and highly customizable script for Reddit. ðŸ˜Š
You said:
Where would I see the toggles?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The toggles are part of the configuration object at the top of the script. Here's where you can see them:

const config = {
    removeNSFWModal: true, // Removes the NSFW modal (set to false to disable this feature)
    removeAppPrompt: true, // Removes the app prompt (set to false to disable this feature)
    unblurNSFWContent: true, // Unblurs NSFW content (set to false to disable this feature)
    unblurThumbnails: true, // Unblurs blurred thumbnails (set to false to disable this feature)
    unblurCommunityHighlightCards: true, // Unblurs community highlight cards (set to false to disable this feature)
    enforceSortByOld: true, // Always sort threads by "old" (set to false to disable this feature)
};

You can enable or disable any feature by setting its value to true or false. For example:

    If you want to stop unblurring NSFW content, change unblurNSFWContent to false.
    If you don't want threads to automatically sort by "old," set enforceSortByOld to false.

Simply modify these values before running the script, and it will adjust its behavior based on your preferences. If you'd like an interface to toggle these dynamically in the browser, I can help add that too! Let me know. ðŸ˜Š
You said:
Yes, it is easier and more professional to edit the preference via a gui
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

Iâ€™ve added a settings menu to the script that allows you to toggle features via a simple GUI. You can now enable or disable options like removing the NSFW modal, sorting threads, or unblurring content directly in the browser.

The menu will appear as a small overlay on the top-right corner of the page. Once you save your settings, theyâ€™ll persist across sessions using localStorage. Youâ€™ll need to reload the page to apply any changes.

Feel free to test it and let me know if you'd like further refinements! ðŸ˜Š
You said:
I see, as I am using privacy related tools, I guess the new window gets killed
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

It seems that privacy-related tools might block certain localStorage functionalities or the UI injection itself. To address this:

    Fallback to Default Settings: If localStorage fails or privacy tools block the menu from appearing, the script should operate with its default settings.

    Alternative Setting Methods: We could add a keyboard shortcut or a special URL query parameter (e.g., ?enhancer-settings) that triggers the settings menu instead of embedding it directly into the DOM. This bypasses any privacy-related interference with DOM injection.

    Confirmation of Permissions: Verify that the script has the necessary permissions in your browser. Some privacy-focused tools restrict JavaScript injection, especially for things like UI overlays.

Would you like me to implement one of these alternatives? For instance, I could add a keyboard-triggered menu or a URL-based configuration loader. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
You said:
Let's go back to the version where you have to edit the script with false or true to enable function. Please activate the functions as default
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

The script has been reverted to use a simple config object where you can enable or disable features by setting their values to true or false. All features are activated by default for your convenience.

Got it! If sorting by age is your main focus, let's simplify the script by disabling or removing the unnecessary NSFW and blur-related functionalities while keeping the sorting by age feature fully functional. Would you like me to clean up the script for this purpose?
You said:
Yes, that was just an example for you so you understand the TemperMonkey script. All I need from the script is to sort comments by 'old'

You said:
Okay, I published it, and started using it, but my first feed wasn't filtered by 'old' What are we missing?
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT

If the first feed (comments page) wasnâ€™t sorted by "old," it might be due to one of these reasons:
1. Page Already Loaded Before Script Execution

The script runs at document-start, which should ideally trigger before the page fully loads. However, if the page is already partially or fully loaded when the script runs, the changes might not take effect.
Solution: Add a Fallback for Late Execution

We can enhance the script to handle cases where the page is already loaded. This ensures the sort is enforced even if the script is executed after the page starts rendering.
